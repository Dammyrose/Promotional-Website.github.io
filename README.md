ABOUT THE AUTHOR


----------

My full name is Oluwadamilola Hephzibah Oshin sometimes called Dammy. I have other names : Roselyn, Granted, and 8 others. 
I am originally from Nigeria and resided in Lagos for 13 years of my life before relocating to Canada in February 2020. 
I speak only English but can understand my native language, Yoruba. I have been learning French most of my life but can not fully grasp it. 
My current hobbies would be listening to music and reading (graphic novels to be clear). I find the public library system fascinating and helpful. Sometimes in my free time I draw (horribly) and crochet odd blankets.
